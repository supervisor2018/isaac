# Isaac Rosenberg for Supervisor 2018

Hello! 

This is the official website of the Isaac Rosenberg for Supervisor 2018 campaign. [Isaac Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/2018Rosenberg) was an official candidate for Elected Office in San Francisco, CA.

Right now the codebase is in Node, with a Postgres DB, deploying on Heroku. We're using Stripe to process donations.

Currently we're fairly close to ready. But right now I need to focus more on the campaign side of things. 

I'm leaving some issues on here, feel free to tackle them. When you're ready, submit a PR and then we can get this live together!
