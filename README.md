# Isaac Rosenberg for Supervisor 2018

Hello! 

This is the official website of the Isaac Rosenberg for Supervisor 2018 campaign. Isaac is an official candidate for Elected Office in San Francisco.

Right now it's in Node, with a Postgres backend, deploying on Heroku. We're using Stripe to process donations.

Currently we're fairly close to ready. But right now I need to focus more on the campaign side of things. 

I'm leaving some issues on here, and you can tackle them. When you're ready, submit a PR and then we can get this live!
